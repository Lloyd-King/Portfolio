        <div class="about1">I'll start this off quite simple.
            <br><br>
            Hi, my name is Lloyd as I'm sure you've seen from the homepage.
            <br>
            I'm a twenty-three year old guy who lives in Leeds, UK. I am currently an employee at John Lewis Leeds,
            <br>
            I have completed a degree in Broadcast Media Production from Teesside University.
            
        </div>

        <div class="about2">
            So what do I do with my spare time? - Well I would say a majority of my time can be spent playing around
            with technology.
            <br>
            I like to spend time building computers and playing around with editing software and similar programs, mainly premier pro and OBS.
            <br>
            On top of those I've actually started to learn how to code. I hope you might be able to recognise this from
            well this website, I've actually
            <br>
            built this thing from the ground up, feel free to have a look at the actual code if you are interested. Just
            don't expect anything ground-breaking.
            <br>
            If you want to have a look at it all. It's avaliable on Github. So just follow the link below 

            <div class="linkContainer">

                    <div class="gitlink">Just click here</div>
                </a>
            </div>       
        </div>

        <div class="about3">
            Aside from my tech side, I am quite heavily into my sports. My main sport is Field Hockey. I've been playing hockey for just about 15 years,  I think.
            <br>
            I have spent a majority of my playing time at Leeds Hockey club. I have also played for my university eventually becoming chairman and helping
            <br>
            us to win the league with an unbeaten season. Here a little picture of the team. I'm the one at the middle bottom if you couldn't already tell.

        <div class="about4">
            I always say that i've come from a sporty family, this is down to my mum who has always been an advocate for being active. 
            <br>
            Unlike my mum though I do have a more competative streak. I won't lie I do get quite competative about most things, 
            <br>
            it's a good thing i'm not too much of a sore loser. Apart from Mario Kart and Mario Party. I feel the need to win those no matter what.
        </div>

        <div class="about5">
            I should finally talk about what I have done in terms of filming and editing. I should start with my childhood goal of wanting to be an actor.
            <br>
            I took my dream of being an actor and joined Escape contemporary youth theatre, from here I performed in a variation of shows at various venues,
            <br>
            including Leeds City hall. From here the youth theatre decided to participate with the Golden Owl awards. The golden owls being a film award show,
            <br>
            specially set up for young filmmakers.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the creation of this film I took interest in the production side, eventually becoming the catalyst for my interest in the film, TV
            <br>
            and general media production. From there on a lot of my skills are self-taught. I am always looking for how I can improve my knowledge 
            <br>
            and ability in the field to create grander and better pieces of work.
