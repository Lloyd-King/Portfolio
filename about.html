                    <br>
                    with the degree being media production I didn't just focus on TV and Film, I spent a 
                    <br>
                    lot of time learning about radio, podcasting, advertising and various other forms of media.

                So what do I do in my spare time?
            </div>
            <div class="about2">
                Well I would say a majority of my time can be spent playing around
                with technology.
                <br><br>
                I like to spend time building computers and playing around with editing software and similar programs, mainly premier pro and OBS.
                <br>
                Something I have found myself recently doing is doing livestreams on Twitch.TV, with OBS and steamlabs mixed together I am able to
                <br>
                play games and talk to people flawlessly. 
                <br><br>
                I also like to be quite active in terms of sport, so during the current Covid-19 lockdown I have found myself performing various
                <br>
                HIIT work outs and I have started running despite my reservations about how much entertainment can be had from it.
                <br><br>
                On top of those I've actually started to learn how to code. I hope you might be able to recognise this from
                well this website, I've actually
                <br>
                built this thing from the ground up, feel free to have a look at the actual code if you are interested. Just
                don't expect anything ground-breaking.
                <br>
                If you want to have a look at it all. It's avaliable on Github. So just follow the link below

                Carrying on from my fore-mentioned interest in sports. My main sport is Field Hockey. I've been playing hockey for just about 15 years,  I think.
                <br>
                I have spent a majority of my playing time at Leeds Hockey club. I have also played for my university eventually becoming chairman and helping
                <br>
                us to win the league with an unbeaten season. Here a little picture of the team. I'm the one at the middle bottom if you couldn't already tell.

            <div class="about4">
                I always say that i've come from a sporty family, this is down to my mum who has always been an advocate for being active. 
                <br>
                Unlike my mum though I do have a more competative streak. I won't lie I do get quite competative about most things, 
                <br>
                it's a good thing i'm not too much of a sore loser. Apart from Mario Kart and Mario Party. I feel the need to win those no matter what.

                I should finally talk about what I have done in terms of filming and editing. I should start with my childhood goal of wanting to be an actor.
                <br>
                I took my dream of being an actor and joined Escape contemporary youth theatre, from here I performed in a variation of shows at various venues,
                <br>
                including Leeds City hall. From here the youth theatre decided to participate with the Golden Owl awards. The golden owls being a film award show,
                <br>
                specially set up for young filmmakers.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the creation of this film I took interest in the production side, eventually becoming the catalyst for my interest in the film, TV
                <br>
                and general media production. From there on a lot of my skills are self-taught. I am always looking for how I can improve my knowledge 
                <br>
                and ability in the field to create grander and better pieces of work. I've embeded the video below so feel free to watch it yourself.
