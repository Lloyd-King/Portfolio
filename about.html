            About Me
        </div>

        <div class="about1">I'll start this off quite simple.
            <br><br>
            Hi, my name is Lloyd as I'm sure you've seen from the homepage.
            <br><br>
            I'm a twenty-three year old guy who lives in Leeds, UK. I am currently an employee at John Lewis Leeds,
            <br>
            where I work in the technical support team. I have been working at the store since 2018. I began my role
            working at
            <br>
            the store after completing my degree in broadcast media production from Teesside University.
            <br>
            Have yourself a look at the picture below and you can see me all happy and posing from my graduation
        </div>

        <div class="about2">
            So what do I do with my spare time? - Well I would say a majority of my time can be spent playing around
            with technology.
            <br>
            I like to spend time building computers and playing around with software such as virtual cables, After
            effects, Affinity and OBS.
            <br>
            On top of those I've actually started to learn how to code. I hope you might be able to recognise this from
            well this website, I've actually
            <br>
            built this thing from the ground up, feel free to have a look at the actual code if you are interested. Just
            don't expect anything ground-breaking.
            <br>
            If you want to have a look at it all. It's avaliable on Github. So just follow the link below 
            <div class="linkContainer">

        <div class="about3">
            Aside from my tech side, I am quite heavily into my sports. My main sport is Field Hockey. I've been playing hockey for just about 15 years,  I think.
            <br>
            I have spent a majority of my playing time at Leeds Hockey club. Making my way from their youth teams to the 2nd team. Ontop of the
            <br>
            time I spent at Leeds hockey club I played for my University team, where I somehow went from a Attacking Midfielder to a Centre back.
            <br>
             I can quite happily say that Teesside University's team helped me develop myself as a person. I even ended up becoming chairman of the club.
            <br>
            That particular season we also happened to finished the season unbeaten in the league and a cup final under our beat.

        <div class="about4">
            I always say that i've come from a sporty family, this is down to my mum who has always been an advocate for being active. 
            <br>
            Unlike my mum though I do have a more competative streak. I won't lie I do get quite competative about most things, 
            <br>
            it's a good thing i'm not too much of a sore loser. Apart from Mario Kart and Mario Party. I feel the need to win those no matter what.

        <div class="about5">
            I should finally talk about what I have done in terms of filming and editing. I should start with my childhood goal of wanting to be an actor.
            <br>
            I took my dream of being an actor and joined Escape contemporary youth theatre, from here I performed in a variation of shows at various venues,
            <br>
            including Leeds City hall. From here the youth theatre decided to participate with the Golden Owl awards. The golden owls being a film award show,
            <br>
            specially set up for young filmmakers. We spent a good 4 weeks creating a piece called "What I would change" this is a piece which looks into young
            <br>
            peoples perspective of the world and what changes they would make to improve the lives of themselves and others no matter how big or small
            <br>
            the issues. During this process I got involved in both the acting side and the production side of the production. This became the catalyst
            <br>
            for my interest in film, TV and general media production. From there on it's been a lot of self-taught skills espically with my editing,
            <br>
            camera work, lighting and production documentations. I have only been able to improve and polish these skills throughout my time at university.
            <br>
