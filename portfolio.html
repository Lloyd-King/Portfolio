        <div class="port3">
            As stated on my "About Me" page, this is my first experence of filmmaking. I originally got interested in the creation side of this project
            <br>
            from working as an actor in the original scene. I asked if they would like further assistance in the production of this product which was
            <br>
            greatly appreciated. I helped with the production performing various roles from cameraman to gaffer and perfomed a wide varity of runner tasks.
            <br>
            I really enjoyed working in the various different roles I performed and with the different types of filming from outside to in-studio work.

            Producer - Degree V Degree
        </div>

        <div class="port3">
            Degree V Degree was a personal project from myself and a fellow student. This project was a livestreamed gameshow, where we took people from
            <br>
            different courses and had them answer various general-knowledge questions. I took up the role as producer on this project with my colleague taking
            <br>
            the role of director. We assembled a team which we both trusted and knew had the abilities required to pull off the project. We had quite limited
            <br>
            resources outside of a studio of which to shoot in. My role mainly comprised of ensureing everyone was pulling thier weight and ensuring we were
            <br> 
            on schedule as well as dealing with any possible difficulties we could face along the way. Despite taking more of a backseat in this production I still
            <br>
            helped out where possible to ensure we had the best possible production. In total this was a 8 week project from start to finish. This was broken down
            <br>
            according to plans we had in place to get the correct host, script and best possible contestants for the show itself. 
            <br><br>
            We ended up livestreaming a first pilot episode lasting 25 minutes through both Facebook and across the student campus. 
            <br> 
            The video of the final project can be seen in the video reel above.

            Editor/Cameraman - Kirkleetham Owl Centre
        </div>

        <div class="port3">
            I worked as both an editor and a cameraman for a promotional film for Kirkleethams owl centre. This was an instance where the owl centre
            <br> 
            themselves approached our univeristy for some filming experience, I jumped at the oppitunity and got involved as soon as possible.
            <br><br>
            It was quite a short filming schdule and turn around, with just 2 filming days and a 4 day edit period. Due to the short filming period
            <br>
            I was asked to help with the filming of the various wildlife within the centre which did also include getting into a cage with snow owls,
            <br>
            eagle owls and vultures. 
            <br><br>
            After the filming dates we met up and went through a group edit. I was the one who made all the changes and the suggestions to what we should
            <br> 
            change and how we should composite the shot. The video was then diplayed on the Owl centres website. It is no longer on there as they changed it
            <br>
            back in 2018. The video is viewable in the video selection area above this.
